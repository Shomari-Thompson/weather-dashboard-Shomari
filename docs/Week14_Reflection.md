My custom feature is a temperature trend graph with random weather insights. It uses Matplotlib to display recent temperature data from the saved CSV log in a separate Tkinter window. Alongside the graph, the app shows a randomly selected text summary that gives users a simple interpretation of the trend, adding a more engaging and personalized touch. Currently, the graph may not display if the data file is missing or improperly formatted, so improving error messaging and adding file validation are next steps. I also plan to enhance this feature by adding filters for date range or city selection in the future.
