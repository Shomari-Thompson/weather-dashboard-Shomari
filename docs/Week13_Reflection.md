I implemented the API call using the requests library in a separate api_handler.py module, which sends a GET request to the OpenWeatherMap API with a city name and displays the result in the GUI. The response includes temperature and weather conditions, which are then shown in the app and logged into a CSV file using the file_manager.py module. One challenge I faced was making sure the API key was kept secure and not accidentally pushed to GitHub, which I solved by isolating it in config.py and using a .gitignore file. Another blocker was handling invalid or misspelled city inputs, but I resolved this by adding error-handling with tkinter.messagebox. Next steps include refining the user interface and finishing the temperature graph feature.
